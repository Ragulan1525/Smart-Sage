## How It Works (RAG Architecture)

1. **User asks a question.**  
2. **The chatbot searches ChromaDB for relevant stored knowledge.**  
3. **If no relevant data is found, it searches Wikipedia and educational websites.**  
4. **If no online sources match, it generates a response using Ollama's LLM.**  
5. **Stores useful responses in ChromaDB for future retrieval.**

## Conclusion

The **AI Study Helper Chatbot** is a powerful tool designed to enhance learning by providing **accurate, relevant, and interactive educational support**. By combining **retrieval-based knowledge** with **AI-generated responses**, it ensures that users receive **high-quality study assistance**.

Future enhancements could include **multi-language support**, **more advanced AI models**, and **integration with additional learning platforms**.  

This project demonstrates the **potential of AI in education** and how **RAG-based chatbots** can revolutionize the way students and educators access information.
