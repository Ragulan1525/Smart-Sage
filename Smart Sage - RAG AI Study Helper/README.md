Smart Sage - AI Study Helper Chatbot
A smart AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users with educational queries using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It integrates ChromaDB, web scraping, Wikipedia search, and file processing (PDF, DOCX, TXT) to provide accurate study-related responses.

How It Works (RAG Architecture)
User asks a question.
The chatbot searches ChromaDB for relevant stored knowledge.
If no relevant data is found, it searches Wikipedia and educational websites.
If no online sources match, it generates a response using Ollama's LLM.
Stores useful responses in ChromaDB for future retrieval.

Conclusion
The AI Study Helper Chatbot is a powerful tool designed to enhance learning by providing accurate, relevant, and interactive educational support. By combining retrieval-based knowledge with AI-generated responses, it ensures that users receive high-quality study assistance. Future enhancements could include multi-language support, more advanced AI models, and integration with additional learning platforms.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI in education and how RAG-based chatbots can revolutionize the way students and educators access information.
